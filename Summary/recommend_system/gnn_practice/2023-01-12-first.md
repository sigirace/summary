## 1. Introduction

이 영상은 추천 시스템을 위한 Graph Neural Network(GNN) 및 그래프 데이터의 전처리를 다루고 있다.

## 2. Graph Neural 



## 3. Graph Representation

basically given where meaning we`re going to process the input data in the from of graph.

 so we pre-process input data in graph form and then we feed the model and we design the model to be able to handle this graph type of input

gnn has many applications if you look at modern society we have social media which is essentially social network we have many purchase intreactions that`s essentially user item interactions that can be modeled and applied to recommendation system we also have knowledge graph for example for science research or for movies you have all these knowledge graph that is essentially

one of the common comparison that people drew similarity from is convolutional neural network so a lot of people say these two are very similar

cnn work is commonly used to process images if you look at image it is essentially input as pixel gird so for example here right you have a four times four picture so it is a low definition picture and you have this green box that slide over your picture pixel grid to extract and to get a more condensed information so if you look at this right you have an input of 4 times 4 pixel gird and when you do this box sliding your and you take the either the max or the average of values within each box then you are getting a two times two matrix and that basically gives you a more condensed information or it is called a higher level information of your image.

so now let`s look at graph how do we do that we can`t have a box moving if graph does not look as nicely organized as kind of like a square grid. so where is this conclusion of similarity come from or and how do we understand it. so if you look at cnn instead of understanding each small grid within your sliding box lets just say here like a three times three you look at it as i have a central node here and whatever i extract from this box is essentially given the central node and it is eight neighbors that is surrounding it. sometimes including self what is the aggregate information of red point.
